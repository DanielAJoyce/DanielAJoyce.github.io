# Portfolio Website

## The aims of this website are as follows:
- To show off my main work, especially that revolving around multiple web programming languages and frameworks.
- Give people an understanding of what I am skilled at and what I enjoy doing

### This will be done in Bootstrap with some minimal Javascript/JQuery.
