# Old Portfolio Website

## The aims of this website were the following::
- To show off my main side-project work, especially that revolving around multiple web programming languages and frameworks.
- Give people an understanding of what I am skilled at and what I enjoy doing

### This was done purely in HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. No Javascript was required.
